 * Repository interface for accessing and manipulating {@link Task} aggregates in the domain layer.

 * <p>
 * This interface abstracts the persistence mechanism, allowing the domain to remain decoupled from
 * any specific database, ORM framework, or implementation detail. Concrete implementations may use
 * technologies such as JPA, JDBC, or in-memory storage.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * All input and output types are domain models. Internally, implementations may perform conversions
 * to and from persistence models (e.g., JPA entities).
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Returned domain objects are <strong>detached from the persistence context</strong>. They are
 * fully mapped representations of the underlying data and are not managed by any ORM or session.
 * Modifications to these objects will not be automatically persisted.
